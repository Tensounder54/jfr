# JFR 
### Java Freecycle Reader ###

A Java library that allows programmers to read pages from [freecycle.org](https://www.freecycle.org/).

The library allows you to traverse pages of [freecycle.org](https://www.freecycle.org/) in order to display the pages to the user. The library uses [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/) to scan the pages of Freecycle to generate objects to perform operations on.

# Installing... #

### ...as Software ###

Currently if you want to run the project the best thing to do is open the project in a Java [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) such as [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ "IntelliJ IDEA Home Page"), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ "Eclipse Home Page"), [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/ "NetBeans Home Page") or [BlueJ](https://bluej.org/ "BlueJ Home Page").

Once there build the project and run the main method. This will start up the library in a user friendly mode.

### ...as a Library ###

To do this you will need to open the project in a Java IDE and then compile it to a `.jar` file. 

- In [IntelliJ IDEA](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1051705 "How to add external jar's in IntelliJ IDEA.").
- In [Eclipse](http://www.oxfordmathcenter.com/drupal7/node/44#page-title "How to add external jar's in Eclipse.").
- In [NetBeans](https://community.oracle.com/thread/1206296 "How to add external jar's in NetBeans.").
- In [BlueJ](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51206621 "How to add external jar's in BlueJ.").

----------

# Example Usage #

Nothing as of yet but I'll get around to this don't worry.

----------

# Development #

If you want to load the project up I personally recommend using IntelliJ IDEA as that's what the library was originally written in. When you load it up, you will need to [install](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1051705 "How to add external jar's in IntelliJ IDEA.") [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/) as a jar. Then your all good to go. 

----------

# Contributing #

If you would like to contribute to the project then that's fantasic! We'd love the help. I'd recommend you start by taking a look at the [issue tracker](/issues). If ther is nothing there that you think you can fix then feel free to make a [pull request](/compare) with some changes then feel free. The dev team will take a look at it and see if we want to implement the change.
