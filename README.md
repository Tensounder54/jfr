# JFR 
### Java Freecycle Reader ###

A Java library that allows programmers to read pages from [freecycle.org](https://www.freecycle.org/).

The library allows you to traverse pages of [freecycle.org](https://www.freecycle.org/) in order to display the pages to the user. The library uses [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/) to scan the pages of Freecycle to generate objects to perform operations on.

----------

# Installing #

[Install](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1051705 "How to add external jar's in IntelliJ IDEA.") [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/) as a jar and then open the project in a Java IDE and then compile it to a `.jar` file. 

- In [IntelliJ IDEA](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1051705 "How to add external jar's in IntelliJ IDEA.").
- In [Eclipse](http://www.oxfordmathcenter.com/drupal7/node/44#page-title "How to add external jar's in Eclipse.").
- In [NetBeans](https://community.oracle.com/thread/1206296 "How to add external jar's in NetBeans.").
- In [BlueJ](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51206621 "How to add external jar's in BlueJ.").

**Please note that there is no released `.jar` file at this time. I will release one soon; when I find the time to do so.**

----------

# Example Usage #

Nothing as of yet but I'll get around to this don't worry.

----------

# Development #

If you want to load the project up I personally recommend using IntelliJ IDEA as that's what the library was originally written in. When you load it up, you will need to [install](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1051705 "How to add external jar's in IntelliJ IDEA.") [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/) as a jar. Then your all good to go. 

----------

# Contributing #

If you would like to contribute to the project then that's fantastic! We'd love the help. I'd recommend you start by taking a look at the [issue tracker](../../issues). If there is nothing there that you think you can fix then please ask for help. We're are always happy to give you pointers. If you've made some changes, feel free to make a [pull request](../../compare), the dev team will take a look at it and see if we want to implement the change.
